Note to future self,
When you finally find that happiness in your life and in someone else, please listen to this song again one day.
Maybe that day could be when you are at the lowest point in your life, maybe it could be when you're the happiest man on earth.
But just know, however you feel on that day, you will listen to this song, and you will change.
You will learn to cherish every moment in your life, good or bad, even if you forget many memories, I hope you will still remember the meaning behind them.
That every single moment you have experienced, even the memories you hate so much, you just want to forget them,
They are what makes you, you.
So please don't have any regrets, cherish your past, and be happy, for our sake.
